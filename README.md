# File Size on Toolbar

A VS Code Extension to display text file sizes on the toolbar below because I am fed-up of VS Code not including it in the main app.

## Features

1. Fast and snappy file size display on the toolbar
2. No configuration required. It just _works_.
3. Live file size for un-saved files
4. Updates file size display on save for files on disk.

## Preview

> This extension does not work with images, binaries, blobs and other file types. Support coming soon. [Open an Issue for wanted features, and I'll try to do my best to work it out.](https://github.com/cliff-4/VSC-file-size-on-toolbar).

## Requirements (for contributing)

1. For development, run `npm install` to install the node modules.
2. For Debugging, go to Debug panel and `Run Extension` to start a VS Code debugging session with the extension.

## Extension Settings

None as of yet. It a simple application lol. Although I'm working for customizing the usage experience in settings, but it's a huge hassle to get that shit to work.

## Known Issues

-   Does not work against non-text files

## Release Notes

Will add more as I progress through it more.
